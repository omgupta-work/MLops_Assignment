## Docker Containerization
To containerize the machine learning model and its dependencies, follow these steps:
1. Install Docker if you haven't already: [Docker Installation Guide](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).
2. Build the Docker image from the Dockerfile: docker build -t my-ml-model .
Run the Docker container: docker run my-ml-model
